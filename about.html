  <h1> Who am I? </h1>

  <p>My name is Diana Montero, and I currently reside in Southaven, Mississippi. At 20 years old, I'm passionate about making the most of my time and experiences. I enjoy spending quality time with my loved ones, 
    whether that means enjoying a cozy night in or exploring new places together. In my free time, I love playing tennis, which not only keeps me active but also provides a great way to challenge myself. I enjoy 
    building Legos, which sparks my creativity and problem-solving skills. Traveling is one of my greatest joys, as it allows me to create lasting memories. Above all, I have a deep passion for design and development, 
    where I can blend my artistic vision with technical skills to create engaging and meaningful projects.</p>
  <p>I aspire to become a Web Developer, ideally working for a company in tech, health, or even the automobile industry. I’m particularly drawn to roles where I can create intuitive, user-friendly experiences that
    make a real impact.</p>
  <p>I am a huge foodie and enjoy all kinds of food. Some of my absolute favorites are Indian dishes, especially butter chicken and tikka masala. I also can’t resist a good burger from Huey’s, and I always enjoy
    a delicious Cajun seafood boil from Red Pier. </p>
